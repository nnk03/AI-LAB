For each of the words `w` (spam or non-spam), estimate the likelihood probabilities (aka the conditional probabilities) `Pr(W = w | T=spam)` and `Pr(W=w | T=non-spam)` as two separate functions. Note  that in order to compute these likelihoods this, you need to compute how many times `w` appears in the corpus (spam or not spam) and the total number of words (including duplicates) in that corpus. If a word does not occur at all, then assign it a non-zero yet small probability fixed suitably. Note that the likelihoods `Pr(w | spam)` and `Pr(w | non-spam)` have to be estimated after suitably removing articles and propositions as done in (a). "
