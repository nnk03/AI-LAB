    "Consider the following simplified variant of the first innings of a one-day cricket match. The innings consists of 300 balls and at any point of time, treat the pair of batsmen playing as a single player. That is, there are 10 players: $(1, 2),(2, 3), \\ldots ,(10, 11)$ with exactly one of them batting. In each ball, there are 5 possible shots $A=\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}$ and  each of these shots is associated with a risk of the player getting out. This risk varies from player to player. The probabilities of getting out for Player $(1, 2)$ is $pOutMin = [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3]$ and for Player $(10, 11)$ is $pOutMax = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]$,  where the $i$th entry is for the $i$th action. If there are $w$ wickets in hand, then use the formula $pOut(a, w) = pOutMax(a) - (pOutMax(a)-pOutMin(a)) \\times (w- 1)/9)$ to calculate the probabilities of getting out for Player $(11-w, 11-w+1)$ where $w \\in [10]$. Note that $pOut(a, 1)=pOutMin(a)$ and $pOut(a, 10)=pOutMax(a)$. Taking $pRunMin = 0.5$, and $pRunMax = 0.8$,  when the player is not getting out, the probability of successfully obtaining the runs for that shot is given by $pRun(w) = pRunMin + (pRunMax - pRunMin) \\times ((w - 1)/9).$\n",
