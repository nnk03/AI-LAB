The day of 15th August 1947 has been embossed in the golden history of India. It is the day when India got its freedom from 200 years of British rule. It was a hard and long struggle in which many freedom fighters and great men sacrificed their lives for our beloved motherland.

India celebrates its Independence Day on the 15th of August every year. However, this year, the auspicious day is being celebrated as ‘75 Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav 2022’ to commemorate 75 long years of India’s independence. Independence Day, called the Red-Letter Day in the history of our country, is celebrated as a national holiday throughout India.
