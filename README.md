# AI-LAB

This is the repository for the code of artificial intelligence laboratory

[Lab 1](./LAB%201/) has beginner friendly problem statements which are related to implementation and simulation such as the "Monty Hall problem" and "Birthday Paradox".

[Lab 2](./LAB%202/) has 3 problem statements, first one being "Text Generation (Static Prediction Task)", second one being "Dynamic Control Task (Room Cleaning Robot)", and the third one being a "Cricket Match Simulation" for a fixed run strategy.

[Lab 3](./LAB%203/) deals with informed and uninformed search algorithms.

[Lab 4](./LAB%204/) is based on adversarial search algorithms such as Mini-max and Mini-max with Alpha-Beta pruning.

[Lab 5](./LAB%205/) is based on "Knowledge and Reasoning".

[Lab 6](./LAB%206/) deals with "Probabilistic Reasoning" and the problem statements are based on Naive Bayes Classifier and Bayesian Network.
