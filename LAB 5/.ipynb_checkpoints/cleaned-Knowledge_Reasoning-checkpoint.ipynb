A knave always lies: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false. Now, given a set of statements mentioned by some inhabitants, the problem is to determine whether each of these inhabitants is a knight or a knave.

    "(b) What is your observation on the optimal strategy? Is it a good idea to bat slowly during the early part of the game, keeping wickets in hand? This usually allows a steady increase in the scoring rate, and often results in a last-minute orgy of runs and wickets during the final part of the innings. Or is it better to score quickly in the early part of the innings? How would the optimal strategy change if there is a chance that a player does not score the runs for a particular shot despite not getting dismissed. Taking $pRunMin = 0.5$, and $pRunMax = 0.8$,  when the player is not getting out, the probability of successfully obtaining the runs for that shot is given by $pRun(w) = pRunMin + (pRunMax - pRunMin) \\times ((w - 1)/9).$"
